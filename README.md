This project is still currently under developement and is not to be used in production.

Currently crashes happen during adding media if it has a file name with non standard characters, or if something goes wrong whilst trying to retrieve media info.
However it has been tested with running a playlist for 12 hours and worked fine.

Feel free to suggest edits or code on top of this, just send me an email at thomas@creativityfilms.gr
